    "Advantages:\n",
    "- The model doesn't need any data about other users, since the recommendations are specific to this user. This makes it easier to scale to a large number of users.\n",
    "- The model can capture the specific interests of a user, and can recommend niche items that very few other users are interested in.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Cannot handle fresh items. The prediction of the model for a given (user, item) pair is the dot product of the corresponding embeddings. So, if an item is not seen during training, the system can't create an embedding for it and can't query the model with this item. This issue is often called the cold-start problem.\n",
